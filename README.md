# Hotel Bookings Project

This project is part of the **GTC ML Project 1** assignment.  
The dataset used: `hotel_bookings.csv` (City and Resort Hotel bookings from Kaggle).  

## Steps Done
1. Uploaded dataset to Google Colab.
2. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
3. Cleaned missing values, handled duplicates, and outliers.
4. Feature Engineering (created `total_guests`, `total_nights`, `is_family`).
5. Encoded categorical features (One-Hot + Frequency Encoding) and scaled numerical features.
6. Split data into train and test sets.
7. Saved cleaned and preprocessed datasets.

## Files in this repository
- `hotel_bookings.csv` – original dataset.
- `hotel_bookings_cleaned.csv` – cleaned dataset.
- `hotel_bookings_preprocessed.csv` – preprocessed dataset (ready for ML).
- `notebook.ipynb` – Google Colab notebook with all steps and code.

## How to use
Open the notebook in Google Colab and run all cells to reproduce the results.
